# BitBurner scripts

## What is this?

These are the personally developed scripts for the [BitBurner idle hacking game](https://danielyxie.github.io/bitburner/).

Can be deployed to a running instance with the `deploy.py` script. Wouldn't
recommend it though, these scripts evolve as more things are unlocked with no
regard for backwards compatibility.
